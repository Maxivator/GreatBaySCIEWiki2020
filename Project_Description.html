    <h1>Inspiration</h1>
    <p>
      Have you ever picked and cooked mushrooms? Wild mushroom picking exists in the culture of many countries, for example, in Yunnan province of China, local families would often climb up mountains to pick mushrooms in forests.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, not all mushrooms are edible. Some of them are extremely poisonous, and can lead to severe cases of intoxication and even death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, food poisoning due to naturally-occurring mushroom toxins is evolving into a larger problem. In the report "Mushroom Poisoning Outbreaks -- China, 2019" by CCDC (Chinese Center for Disease Control and prevention), it was pointed out that in the year 2019 alone, there are 276 cases of mushroom poisoning, involving 769 patients from 19 provinces.
      This takes up 50% of all food poisoning cases in that year in China.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are 435 known species of poisonous mushrooms in China, and are distributed mostly in the Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangxi and Guangdong provinces. According to the report, the lethal rate of mushroom intoxication ranges from 11.69% to 42.30%.
      In which, the lethal rate of the hepatotoxic toxins contained by mushrooms species of the Amanita genus -- amatoxins can be as high as 80-90%.
    </p>
    <p>
      Globally, the problem of mushroom poisoning is also severe. Until today, there are 140 thousand known species of large fungi (mushrooms) all over the world. 50,000-100,000 people die from mushroom poisoning annually, which are mostly concentrated in Europe, the United States, Japan, China, and Iran.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toxic mushrooms not only harm people's lives, cases of animal ingestion and intoxication aren't rare. According to the reports by APCC (Animal Poison Control Center) in years 2006 to 2010, they have received 2090 cases of animal mushroom poisoning cases, in which 1732 cases involves household pet dogs.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was commonly taught that colorful mushrooms are usually poisonous, while dull-colored ones are usually non-poisonous. However, this can be misleading at times. For instance, the bright-orange-colored <b><i>Amanita caesarea</i></b>:
    </p>
    <div class="image-center">
      <img src="Assets/Pictures/Amanita_caesarea.png" style="width: 20%"/>
      <p class="figure-description">Figure 1. The bright-orange <i>Amanita caesarea</i>.</p>
    </div>
    <p>
      is actually non-toxic and nutritious,
      while the white-colored innocent-looking <b><i>Amanita verna</i></b>:
    </p>
    <div class="image-center">
      <img src="Assets/Pictures/Amanita_verna.png" style="width: 20%"/>
      <p class="figure-description">Figure 2. The white-colored innocent-looking <i>Amanita verna</i>.</p>
    </div>
    <p>
      contains lethal toxins.
    </p>
    <p>
      How are we going to discern toxic mushrooms from non-toxic ones, if their appearances are so deceitful?
    </p>
