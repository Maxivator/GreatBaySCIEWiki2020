          <h1>Inspiration</h1>
          <p>
            Globally, tens of thousands of people die from mushroom poisoning each year. It was commonly taught that colorful mushrooms are usually poisonous, while dull-colored ones are usually non-poisonous. However, this can be misleading at times. For instance, the bright-orange-colored <i>Amanita caesarea</i> is actually non-toxic and nutritious,
            while the white-colored innocent-looking <i>Amanita verna</i> contains one of the deadliest mushroom toxins - amanitins.
            How are we going to discern toxic mushrooms from non-toxic ones, if their appearances are so deceitful?

          <h1>Abstract</h1>
          <p>
            We plan on developing a highly-efficient and membrane-based test kit for several common types of toxins present in mushrooms, such as amatoxins and phallotoxins.
            According to our research, we plan on improving the LFIA (Lateral-Flow Immunoassay) technology, by using aptamers - single-stranded DNA folded into their secondary structures - instead of antibodies, which were originally used in the technology.
            Due to the use of aptamers, we name our improved technology LFAA (Lateral-Flow Apta-Assay). This can hopefully improve the disadvantages of antibodies in immunoassays such as low heat-stability, occasional false-negative results,
            and the reliance on the immunogenicity of the target molecules.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same time, we plan on developing a sandwich assay, which involves both aptamers and antibodies. We hope that this would combine the benefits of using either ligand, and enhance the test results by a substantial amount.
            We choose to use scFv molecules, namely Single-Chained antibody Fragments, instead of actual antibodies. Because scFvs are monoclonal, meaning that they can be synthesized through normal proteinsynthesis procedures in genetically engineered cells.
            This not only simplifies the production process of antibodies hugely (as normal procedures involve the immune system of living animals), but also reduces cost.
          </p>
          <p>
            Furthermore, we plan on amplify the test results by using the RPA technology in order to enhance the sensitivity of the test, and design a mobile application to qualitatively and quantitatively analyze the results.
          </p>
          <p>
            Last but not least, we wrap the core technologies and reagents into a test kit hardware, whose outer shape resembles that of a pregnancy test.
            We hope that this test kit can help local mushroom pickers to identify several common species of poisonous mushrooms, and to reduce cases of intoxication and death worldwide.
