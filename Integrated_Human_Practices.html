      <h1>1. Interview with Professor Deng of Guangdong Institute Of Microbiology</h1>
      <p>
        In order to find out more about how mushroom poisoning affects our local region - the southern part of China, we interviewed Professor Wangqiu Deng from Guangdong Institute of Microbiology. Professor Deng informed us with rich, professional opinions, and we became clearer at our project aim, the target population of our detector, and the current detection method used in laboratories.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Who and why mushrooms are picked up and eaten?</b> In Guangdong Province, for example, the capital city Guangzhou, people have high awareness of avoiding mushrooming under the publicity of the government for many years. However, some remote areas like places in Qingyuan, Dongguan, and Zhongshan, many people are still mushrooming for meals for the whole family, which leads to severe cases of mushroom poisoning every year. People in many other regions of China has the habit of mushrooming when the right season comes, and some people just want to taste new things. The majority of the population has little idea on distinguishing poisonous mushrooms, yet they pick wild mushrooms for food quite often. Hence, it is not only the publicity of related knowledge that is necessary, but also a rapid, easy detection method should be promoted to the population.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Current method of mushroom poison detection?</b> We have also acknowledged that the current methods are not good enough even within professional laboratories. Nowadays, the researchers are using HPFC and ELISA for detection, but both of them are time-consuming and inaccurate due to the use of antibodies. There is not a single completed device in the academic field that can provide the rapid, easy, portable detection for mushroom toxin. Professor Deng spoke highly of our project, as our idea might be an answer to the blank in the market. Her words gave us confidence to keep exploring down this track.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Safety?</b> Besides, we consulted Professor Deng about the safety issue that we are going to face when the experiments on amatoxin starts. "The toxin is not lethal through touching," Professor Deng said, "you just need to make sure no one accidently swallow them." As for the disposal, she suggested to use a specific disposal bin for waste collection and contact toxin-dealing companies to help us handle them.

      <h1>2. Interview with Dr. Candace Bever, the author of the core literatures we reviewed</h1>
      <p>
        Dr. Candace Bever is a Research Microbiologist who works in the Foodborne Toxin Detection Department of US Department of Agriculture. We reviewed some of her recent publications on LFIA amatoxin detection, and decided to turn to her for technical advice.
        Zoom meeting with Dr. Bever.

      <h1>3. Interview with EPFL iGEM 2019</h1>
      <p>
        After receiving responses from literature authors of our core technical challenges, we thought it would be as useful if we took advice from past iGEMers. Therefore, knowing that the 2019 iGEM overgrad Grand Prize winner team, EPFL, shared similarities in constructing hardware and Human Practice with our project, we got in touch with them through email and they kindly offered us suggestions in our Zoom meeting.
