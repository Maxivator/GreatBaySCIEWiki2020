      <h1>1. Interview with Professor Deng of Guangdong Institute Of Microbiology</h1>
      <p>
        In order to find out more about how mushroom poisoning affects our local region - the southern part of China, we interviewed Professor Wangqiu Deng from Guangdong Institute of Microbiology. Professor Deng informed us with rich, professional opinions, and we became clearer at our project aim, the target population of our detector, and the current detection method used in laboratories.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Who and why mushrooms are picked up and eaten?</b> In Guangdong Province, for example, the capital city Guangzhou, people have high awareness of avoiding mushrooming under the publicity of the government for many years. However, some remote areas like places in Qingyuan, Dongguan, and Zhongshan, many people are still mushrooming for meals for the whole family, which leads to severe cases of mushroom poisoning every year. People in many other regions of China has the habit of mushrooming when the right season comes, and some people just want to taste new things. The majority of the population has little idea on distinguishing poisonous mushrooms, yet they pick wild mushrooms for food quite often. Hence, it is not only the publicity of related knowledge that is necessary, but also a rapid, easy detection method should be promoted to the population.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Current method of mushroom poison detection?</b> We have also acknowledged that the current methods are not good enough even within professional laboratories. Nowadays, the researchers are using HPFC and ELISA for detection, but both of them are time-consuming and inaccurate due to the use of antibodies. There is not a single completed device in the academic field that can provide the rapid, easy, portable detection for mushroom toxin. Professor Deng spoke highly of our project, as our idea might be an answer to the blank in the market. Her words gave us confidence to keep exploring down this track.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Safety?</b> Besides, we consulted Professor Deng about the safety issue that we are going to face when the experiments on amatoxin starts. "The toxin is not lethal through touching," Professor Deng said, "you just need to make sure no one accidently swallow them." As for the disposal, she suggested to use a specific disposal bin for waste collection and contact toxin-dealing companies to help us handle them.

      <h1>2. Interview with Dr. Candace Bever</h1>
        <h2>Project Content</h2>
        <p>
          We would like to create a toolbox based on sliding chip components and LFIA teststrip, to detect not only amatoxins but also some types of phallotoxins and if possible, other commonly found plant toxins.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on your extraordinary work on Lateral-Flow Immunoassay, we see the prospect of a rapid and portable kit for the point-of-care detection before eating and also for the diagnosis after eating, reducing the mushroom-poisoning incidence as well as increase the survival rates of the poisonous mushroom consumers.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have gone through the doubts such as "To what extent the rapid detection of amatoxin is going to help the society? Because only a few thousands cases were reported in the past ten years globally."
        </p>
        <p>
          However, as an alternative to antibodies in LFIA, we adopted aptamers, selected by the Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential Enrichment - known as the SELEX procedure, to be the binding receptors of the mushroom toxins. Hence this alternative assay is given the name "Lateral-Flow Apta-Assay", (LFAA). This could hopefully improve the test results and sensitivity as the binding affinities of aptamers is comparatively larger（higher？）. Furthermore, since aptamers are simply single-stranded DNA strands folded into their secondary structures, we can use RPA signal amplification to magnify the results and hence improving the sensitivity of the test. Last but not least, there would be no need for antigen conjugation on non-immonugenic toxin molecules.
        </p>
        <p>
          We would apply lyophilized aptamers on the conjugation pad and the testline. We would also place immobilized toxin molecules - fixed on the test line - which will compete with the free toxin molecules in the sample, in binding the limited amount of aptamers. Then we would use RPA to amplify the aptamers bound to the immobilized target, and use gold nanoparticles as a dyeing agent
        </p>
        <p>
          The higher the number of aptamer bound to the immobilized toxins and not to the free toxin molecules in the sample, the deeper the red color, which means the immobilized toxin molecules greatly outnumber the toxin molecules in the sample, and hence the mushroom contains very little toxin, and is edible. Vice versa.

            Dr. Bever, are there any large opportunity costs of using aptamers in our project?

          <b><li>
            Dr. Bever, would there be any complexities to detect mushroom toxin before eating from the mushroom directly compared to urine test?

            </ul>

          <b><li>
            We would like to introduce an absorbing pad to ideally absorb all free amatoxin-aptamer complex. Is it possible to achieve this solely by the fluid-guiding effect of cellulose acetate membrane on the test-strip?

      <h1>3. Interview with EPFL iGEM 2019</h1>
      <p>
        After receiving responses from literature authors of our core technical challenges, we thought it would be as useful if we took advice from past iGEMers. Therefore, knowing that the 2019 iGEM overgrad Grand Prize winner team, EPFL, shared similarities in constructing hardware and Human Practice with our project, we got in touch with them through email and they kindly offered us suggestions in our Zoom meeting.
